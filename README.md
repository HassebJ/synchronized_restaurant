# synchronized_restaurant
Project for Course : 6431 - Advanced Operating Systems at Ohio State

**Goal:** To master use the of synchronization primitives in either with Java or a C library, and carry out a substantial multi-threaded implementation using these.

**Problem:** Restaurant 6431 is now open. A restaurant requires careful coordination of resources, which are the tables in the restaurant, the cooks available to cook the order, and the machines available to cook the food (we assume that there is no contention on other possible resources, like servers to take order and serve the orders).
